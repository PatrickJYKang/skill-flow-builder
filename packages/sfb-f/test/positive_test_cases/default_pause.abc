// Similar to a real game where the player would pause in the middle of gameplay,
// and come back and resume later from a certain point, saving variables (progress).
// Clears hitPoints from any previous playthroughs, then sets it to 10.
// When you pause, the skill ends, and then when the skill resumes, it should drop you in the @resume scene with your hitPoints set to 10.
// The only true way to test this is manually on the dev console/device (or through ASK dialog).

@default pause test
    *say
        Welcome to the pause and resume test.
        Say continue to drink a health potion!
    *then
		clear hitPoints
		set hitPoints to 10
        hear continue {
			-> pt pause
		}

@default pt pause
	*say
		// should be 10 hit points.
		You have {hitPoints} hit points!
		Say pause to pause the game!
		Say end to end the test.
		Or say drink to drink another health potion!
	*then
		// pause invocation should hit pause scene without specifying utterance
		
		// quits the test when you are done
		hear end {
			clear hitPoints
			-> end
		}
		// increases hitpoints, allowing you to verify a variable can be changed/saved through multiple pause loops
		hear drink {
			increase hitPoints by 10
			-> default pt pause
		}
