    <h4>Release Changes</h4>
    <p>
      The following features have changed or improved.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <ul>
    <li><b>Editor</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We have improved the Editor's ability to handle large (500 scene) files. Tip: use multiple .abc files to structure a skill that is over 500 scenes. This can also make it easier to organize content. 
      </li>
      <li>
        You probably won't notice, but "Writer Mode", represented by the pencil icon, has been removed. Problems with this mode were slowing the Editor, so we removed it in favor of the Editor handling larger skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added undo and redo commands to work with guided mode in the Editor. Window size and position are also remembered when you reopen the editor.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Core Modules</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Coming soon:</b> major updates to technical documentation, coverage includes SFB Build Life Cycle, use of custom extensions, and other advanced use cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Customer Request:</b> You can now use multiple stages: if you want to say create a beta stage and a prod stage for your skill, this often involves creating two separate skills in the Developer Console. To make this easier, you can use the --stage argument with the deploy command when using the sfb-cli.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Customer Request:</b> With very minimal effort, you can now get better insights into how your users are navigating your SFB skills. The tooling supports various levels of configuration; from plug and play all the way to full BI integration. Check out the <a href='https://gist.github.com/superkew/40045d93e630acc246c0f0df7c902053#file-readme-md' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SFB Metrics Extension</a></b></i>
      </li>
      <li>
        Added debug flag to command line simulator to enable quiet mode. Makes it easier to see your project specific logging.
      </li>
      <li>
        Updated core extension classes to make them easier to subclass for your own extensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Snippets now work in localized content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed an issue where recap/reprompt responses were erroneously combining their output.
      </li>
      <li>
        Updated handling of AMAZON.StopIntent to return "shouldEndSession" flag as true to conform to new Alexa policy.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  </p>
